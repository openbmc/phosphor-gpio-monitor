      "message": "It should be the same work. The init handlers would need some logic to avoid duplication. For example the following condition:\n1. stuff broken. active high GPIO asserts.\n2. RISING handling calls the assert sd service.\n3. stuff continues to be broken. BMC restarts or someone restarts gpiod service.\n4. INIT_HIGH gets called, calls the new target.\n\nThe new target has to ensure that the new condition is not already reported/handled. Else if it does the not-so-smart-stuff.
